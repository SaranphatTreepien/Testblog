        <h2 style={headingStyles}>What is YOLOv8?</h2>
        <p style={paragraphStyles}>
          YOLOv8, or You Only Look Once version 8, represents the latest
          iteration in the YOLO object detection series. Known for its real-time
          object detection capabilities, YOLOv8 has been designed to improve
          both speed and accuracy. The model has evolved from its predecessors
          to handle a wider range of objects and more complex scenarios, making
          it a versatile tool for various applications.
        </p>
        <p style={paragraphStyles}>
          This version continues the YOLO tradition of performing detection in a
          single pass through the network, which allows for faster processing
          times compared to traditional multi-stage detection systems. YOLOv8
          integrates advancements in deep learning architectures to achieve even
          higher levels of performance.

        <h2 style={headingStyles}>Key Features of YOLOv8</h2>
        <p style={paragraphStyles}>
          YOLOv8 boasts several enhancements over its predecessors. These
          include improved accuracy through more refined feature extraction and
          object localization techniques. The model also benefits from optimized
          processing algorithms that reduce computational load, making it
          suitable for deployment in both edge devices and cloud-based systems.
        </p>
        <p style={paragraphStyles}>
          Additionally, YOLOv8 introduces new capabilities for handling
          occlusions and small objects, which were challenging for earlier
          versions. This makes it an excellent choice for applications in
          security, autonomous driving, and real-time analytics.
